## Bugs.

Since there is no database to support the app, once you exit or log out of a session you loose all the credentials and created user. You have to create a new user for every session.
You can still use the default login but if you exit the app, you will still loose all the credentials you created.
## BBD
```
 the project will require the user to enter username and generate or create his/her password
 view credentials and add 
 exit if finished
 ```
